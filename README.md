# Loxun

Loxun is a dynamically typed, multi-paradigm(ed?), tree-walk interpreter.

## Why

I like the "whys" of the project - lemme brief you in
Why is a good question for a project this size, there are plenty of reasons:
1. its fun
2. i am doing what i am preaching - in candidates i am looking for a deep understanding of computer internals, ds and algos and are they passionate about programming - building an interpreter is perfect for that
3. in my day job i had to recently create a HUGE parser (probably first in the world to do custom bbcode -> block notation for a text editor) and i want to explore ideas 
## Installation and usage
```
$ git clone
$ just build
$ ./loxun or ./loxun <anyfile> (you can look at script.loxun)
